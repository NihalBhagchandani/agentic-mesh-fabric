# Agentic Mesh Fabric

**Agentic Mesh Fabric** is an open architecture for building **safe, scalable, explainable, and composable enterprise AI** — combining the best of:

✅ **Data Mesh** → Domain-owned data and agents  
✅ **Data Fabric** → Semantic discovery, lineage, and global governance  
✅ **Agentic AI** → Autonomous, tool-using agents powered by LLMs and Model Context Protocol (MCP)  

In this architecture, **domain-owned agents** interact with **domain-owned data products** using **MCP** — with full **policy-as-code**, **semantic reasoning**, and **auditable lineage**.
